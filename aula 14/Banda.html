        A boy of anguish, now
        He's a man of soul
        Traded in his misery
        For the lonely life of the road
        
        The years were cruel to him, no
        He won't let them go
        Lays awake tryina find the man inside
        To pack his bags and escape this world
        
        I've never been so torn up in all of my life
        I should have seen this coming
        I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
        I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on
        
        He wanted to change the world
        To make it all worthwhile
        So he put his pen to paper
        And poured out everything inside
        
        His red eyes tearing up
        At the man that he'd became
        Slowly but surely on the fast track
        To falling into his grave
        
        I've never been so torn up in all of my life
        I should have seen this coming
        I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
        I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on
        
        I can't believe I've come so far in such short time (oh)
        And I'm still fighting on my own (all alone)
        If I stop to catch my breath I might never breathe again
        (So just know this)
        
        I've never been so torn up in all of my life
        I can't believe I let myself break down
        
        I've never been so torn up in all of my life
        I should have seen this coming
        I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
        I don't want to do this anymore
        
        I've never been so torn up in all of my life
        I should have seen this coming
        I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
        I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on
        
        A boy of anguish, now
        He's a man of soul
